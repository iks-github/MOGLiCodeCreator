I Preconditions for Release

1. All Unit- (UnitTestExecutor.java), Integration- (tests in project 'inttest') and Systemtests (UnitTestExecutor.java) are known to be green.
2. All sources relevant for the release have been merged to the master branch in the iks-github repository.
3. The master branch is actually checkout out!
4. Check for correct version settings in following three files:
   a) application/src/main/resources/build.properties,
   b) readme.md in root
   c) core/src/main/resources/MOGLi_Code_Creator.htm
5. All htm-files are kown to be UTF-coded (in case of doubt check with Notepad++).



II Perform the Release

1. Add changes between the current and last version (the release notes) to the version history in the readme.md of the repository root.
2. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' set property 'testRun' to 'false'.
3. Perform the complete quality assurance by executing 'application/mavenScripts/runAllSteps.sh' or'application/mavenScripts/windows/runAllSteps.bat'
   and assure that all steps are successful! Alternatively, perform the four steps manually:
   a) Execute unit tests for ReleaseBuilder (use BuildTestExecutor.java) if Release Builder Code has changed.
   b) Execute 'mvn install' on the parent project - this unit tests and creates the binaries.
   c) Execute integration tests (Start 'Run as JUnit Test' on the project 'inttest').
   d) Execute 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java' as JUnit test. This builds the release candidate and executes the system tests automatically on it.
4. Verify that in 'application/releaseBuilds' the Release Candidate can be found.
   If not check that property 'testRun' is 'false' in file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties'.
5. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' set property 'testRun' back to 'true'.
   This allows test runs of the release process executed automatically by 'BuildReleaseAndTestSystem.java'.
6. In file 'application/src/main/resources/build.properties' adapt the three version settings to new (higher) values!

    
 
III Finishing steps

1. Open 'application/target/releaseDir/SystemTestDir/help/MOGLi Code Creator.htm' in a web browser and check
   a) Is the file readable? If not, encoding of file in repository is not UTF-8!
   b) Is MOGLiCC version correct?
   c) Are all links working?
2. Perform the complete quality assurance of II 3 again, to check that the new versions (set in II 6) are set correctly.
3. Check that a tag for the current release was automatically created - if not do it manually (pattern: vX.Y.Z).
4. Commit the current sources in the master branch with comment 'Release X.Y.Z' and push them to the github remote repository
5. Eventually merge the new changes to other branches such as 'development'
