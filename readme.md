#The MOGLi Code Creator   

* * *

Just another code generator? - NO! - It's THE Lightweight autogeneration tool! 

It's provides inserting into existing files, making complete new files and building trees of files within the file system.

It's a small standalone Tool for a quick start into model based development!

It's easy to learn, to apply and to integrate in your IDE.

It's quick in execution.

It's failsafe because it supports Reverse Engineering: re-generate your artefacts as your wish.

It's written in Java but made to generate all kinds of text documents.

**Changes to 1.0.1**
- New property 'BraceSymbolForMetaInfoValues' for the plugin.properties file of the StandardModelProvider. By replacing the standard symbol Double Quotes <"> by another symbol Double Quotes can be used within names or values of MetaInfos. Detailed Information is available in the default _model.properties file of the StandardModelProvider.
- New template header attribute '@OutputEncodingFormat' that is used by generator plugins to create output files. See also <root dir>\help\VelocityModelBasedInserter\TemplateFileHeaderInserterAttributes.htm and <root dir>\help\VelocityClassBasedGenerator\TemplateFileHeaderInserterAttributes.htm
- New Feature when starting MOGLiCC: an argument specifying the workspace to use can be defined. If not set, the workspace to use is read from the application properies file as in version 1.0.1.See <rootDir>/startMOGLiCodeCreator.bat
- New type of MetaInfo validation introduced: MetaInfo can be validated both by number of occurrences and by MetaInfo values. In addition, validation can depend on conditions that must be met. For this purpose a specific MetaInfoValidator-DSL is introduced.Detailed Information is available in the default MetaInfo.validation file of the VelocityClassBasedGenerator.
- Since V1.1.0 plugins are deactivated by default. To activate plugins, a corresponding activation setting in the workspace.properties file must exist.
