#The MOGLi Code Creator   

* * *

Just another code generator? - NO! - It's THE Lightweight autogeneration tool! 

It's provides inserting into existing files, making complete new files and building trees of files within the file system.

It's a small standalone Tool for a quick start into model based development!

It's easy to learn, to apply and to integrate in your IDE.

It's quick in execution.

It's failsafe because it supports Reverse Engineering: re-generate your artefacts as your wish.

It's written in Java but made to generate all kinds of text documents.
