The MOGLiCC **provider.model.standard.excel** project provides the functionality of the **ExcelStandardModelProvider**.
The ExcelStandardModelProvider is an extension of the StandardModelProvider.
The ExcelStandardModelProvider enriches the model data read from the model file of the StandardModelProvider by additional model data read from an Excel file.
This is especially useful to manage large data sets, e.g. test data, and use them for code generation.
